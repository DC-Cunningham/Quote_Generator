## Installation

The application has been deployed [here](https://dc-cunningham.github.io/Quote_Generator/)

## Usage

On loading of the page a quote and author is rendered by DOM manipulation.

The first buttons allows for the current quote to be shared via the Twitter [Web Intent URL](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/tweet-button/guides/web-intent) function.

The second button allows for a new quote to be fetched.

## Future Plans and Known Bugs

Would like to implement a facebook share button
